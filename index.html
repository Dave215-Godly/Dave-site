      <h2>What is it?</h2>

        This is a <b>new website</b>

    About a hundred years ago, Silvana city was rich in gold, the government took it all, but left a small plot of land with gold. So, the natives took the gold and melted it, it filled five barrels. They used one barrel to make two sculptures, and hid the other four deep in the woods of Silvana city. The golden sculptures were placed in the museum of Silvana city, to be exhibited. The museum also has six dinosaurs fossils, four of them were found by a foreigner called Louis Eric, and the other two were found by my grand-father, he was a paleontologist, and one of the brachiosaurus’ fossil found by my grand-father was covered with gold, it is very beautiful, he made a ton of money, about 3.5 million USD. Silvana city is a nice place to live in, if you like peace and tranquility.

    My family might be a <a href="https://www.wofportal.com" target="_blank"><b>little weird</b></a>, instead of a car, I use a <u>helicopter</u> to go to school, I have a tiger as a pet, and a bear in my backyard (I still do not what it is doing there). I am a smart person; I am a little nerdy. In school, my teacher gave the wrong definition of perspiration, I corrected her and I got detention, which was whack. My school had a talent show on 14 August, 1909. I am an inventor, I am like Michael Faraday, but smarter and more genius-y (if that’s a word). So, for the talent show I made a light bulb that turns off and on through the vibration of sound waves in under two days, and a week was left, so I modified it. I made it in a way that the louder the sound, the brighter the light, I presented it and got 8th position out of nine people. And what made me most angry was that the person who won made a rat wheelie thing.

I went home, angry, VERY ANGRY, raging with fury, so,<br> <i>I slept and dreamt but this time it was like I was in a vortex, I could control my movement, but I could not wake up.  I was moving closer into the forest, and then I heard rustling leaves. I saw a beast jump out of a bush, could that be Bigfoot (in my mind), no that can’t be. Bigfoot is a mythical element used by writers to make money. Am I dreaming? Oh, yeah, I am. I was going closer in search of the four barrels of liquid gold; at last, I found it, the four barrels of liquid gold. I went to lift one of the barrels, and I heard a howling owl, I turned back and saw that same beast, it was a hairy man with big feet! Seeing Bigfoot, I yelled Bigfoot, he answered Sir Dave, and I passed out. I woke up, and everything was bright and then I saw Bigfoot, I was startled. He said “follow me”, a little frightened, and I have nothing to lose. I followed him and he took me outside, the street was made of gold, and diamonds were used to decorate buildings. He took me to a hall called RAPHA; we went inside. I asked him about the four barrels of gold and where I could find them. He said he had something better to show me; he led me to an emerald door, and inside it was more barrels of gold than I could count. And then, I woke up, it was three hours after I slept. A three-day dream lasted for only three hours in real-life.</i>
